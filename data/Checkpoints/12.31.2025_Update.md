## Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a free, public platform showing US immigration data — arrivals, visas, denials by country, port, and visa type. Non-profit, transparency-focused.

**Repository:** github.com/DataForge365/US-Immigration-Data

**License:** Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0)

**Tech Stack:**
- Storage: GitHub (free)
- Editor: VS Code with Jupyter notebooks
- Language: Python 3.13.3
- Data Processing: pandas (to install)
- Database: SQLite (single file)
- Visualization: Datasette (later)
- Hosting: Vercel or Fly.io free tier (later)

## Completed Steps ✅

### Phase 1: GitHub Repository Setup
- [x] Created public GitHub repository
- [x] Set up folder structure:
  ```
  US-Immigration-Data/
  ├── data/
  │   ├── raw/           # Original downloaded files
  │   ├── processed/     # Cleaned CSVs
  │   └── consolidated/  # Final merged datasets
  ├── database/          # SQLite database
  ├── docs/              # Documentation
  ├── scripts/           # Python code
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── LICENSE            # CC BY 4.0
  └── README.md
  ```
- [x] Updated LICENSE from MIT to Creative Commons BY 4.0
- [x] Created `docs/data_dictionary.md` with complete data model schema

### Phase 2: Local Development Environment
- [x] VS Code installed with extensions:
  - Python (Microsoft)
  - Jupyter (Microsoft)
  - GitHub Pull Requests (GitHub)
- [x] GitHub Desktop installed and connected
- [x] Repository cloned to local Mac
- [x] Created first Jupyter notebook: `scripts/01_download_and_explore.ipynb`
- [x] Selected Python kernel: Python 3.13.3

## Current Status 🔄

**Currently at:** Ready to write first code cell to download immigration data

**Next immediate action:** Install pandas and download State Dept NIV Detail Tables

## Data Model Summary

**6 Tables defined in data_dictionary.md:**

| Table | Purpose | Primary Source |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `arrivals` | People entering US at ports | CBP, I-94, DHS Yearbook |
| `visa_issuances` | Visas issued by embassies | State Department |
| `visa_refusals` | Denied visa applications | State Department |
| `inadmissibles` | Denied entry at ports | CBP |
| `overstays` | Stayed past authorization | DHS Entry/Exit Reports |
| `sources` | Metadata tracking | Internal |

**Key columns standardized:**
- Dates: YYYY-MM format
- Countries: ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes (IND, CHN, MEX, etc.)
- Visa classes: Standardized codes (H-1B, F-1, B-1/B-2, etc.)

## Full Source Inventory

A comprehensive CSV with 79 data sources was created earlier, covering:
- PORT_OF_ENTRY: CBP, DHS OHSS, I-94 Program, Land Border, Overstay Reports
- VISA_DATA: State Dept Monthly/Annual, Refusals, USCIS, Wait Times
- OVERSIGHT: GAO Reports, CRS Reports
- RESEARCH: Think tanks (MPI, Pew, TRAC), Academic sources
- DATA_GAPS: What doesn't exist publicly

## Environment Details

**Computer:** MacBook Pro M1

**Python Location:** /usr/local/bin/python3 (Python 3.13.3)

**Required Packages (to install):**
```
pandas
openpyxl
requests
jupyter
sqlite3 (built-in)
```

## Next Steps To Do 🔲

### Immediate:
- [ ] Install pandas and openpyxl in first notebook cell
- [ ] Download State Dept NIV Detail Tables
- [ ] Explore the data structure
- [ ] Save raw file to `data/raw/`

### This Week:
- [ ] Clean and standardize the NIV data
- [ ] Export to `data/processed/`
- [ ] Download DHS Yearbook tables
- [ ] Create SQLite database

### Later:
- [ ] Write GitHub Actions for automated updates
- [ ] Deploy Datasette for public access
- [ ] Build visualization dashboard

## Key Decisions Made

1. **License:** CC BY 4.0 (not MIT) — better for data projects
2. **Database:** SQLite (single file, no server) — appropriate for non-profit
3. **Hosting:** GitHub + Vercel/Fly.io free tier — $0/year
4. **Editor:** VS Code + Jupyter notebooks (not Terminal)
5. **Git tool:** GitHub Desktop (not command-line Git)

## Files Created

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|

| `project_checkpoint.md` | `docs/` | This progress tracker |
| `01_download_and_explore.ipynb` | `scripts/` | First Jupyter notebook |
