## Completed Steps ✅

### Phase 1: GitHub Setup
- [x] Created GitHub repository (public)
- [x] Added folder structure:
  - `data/raw/` — Original downloaded files
  - `data/processed/` — Cleaned/standardized CSVs
  - `data/consolidated/` — Final merged datasets
  - `scripts/` — Python code for scraping/cleaning
  - `docs/` — Documentation
  - `database/` — SQLite database
- [x] Updated LICENSE to CC BY 4.0
- [x] Created `docs/data_dictionary.md` with full data model

### Phase 2: Local Environment
- [x] VS Code installed with Python support
- [x] GitHub Copilot available

## Next Steps To Do 🔲

### Immediate (Phase 2 continued):
- [ ] Install Python extensions in VS Code (Python, Jupyter)
- [ ] Clone GitHub repo to local Mac
- [ ] Set up Python virtual environment
- [ ] Install required packages (pandas, requests, openpyxl, sqlite3)
- [ ] Create first Jupyter notebook for data exploration

### Data Collection (Phase 3):
- [ ] Download first priority dataset: State Dept NIV Detail Tables
- [ ] Download second priority: DHS Yearbook Tables 25-32
- [ ] Download third priority: I-94 Historical Data
- [ ] Save raw files to `data/raw/`

### Data Processing (Phase 4):
- [ ] Write cleaning script for NIV data
- [ ] Standardize country codes (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3)
- [ ] Standardize visa class codes
- [ ] Export cleaned CSVs to `data/processed/`

### Database (Phase 5):
- [ ] Create SQLite database: `database/immigration.db`
- [ ] Load arrivals table
- [ ] Load visa_issuances table
- [ ] Load visa_refusals table
- [ ] Create sources metadata table

### Visualization (Phase 6):
- [ ] Deploy Datasette for public access
- [ ] Create basic charts/dashboards

   - Format: Excel
   - Contains: All visa issuances by class × nationality

2. **DHS Yearbook Tables 25-32**
   - URL: https://ohss.dhs.gov/topics/immigration/yearbook
   - Format: Excel/PDF
   - Contains: Admissions by visa class, country, port, month, demographics

3. **I-94 Historical Data**
   - URL: https://www.trade.gov/i-94-arrivals-historical-data
   - Format: Excel
   - Contains: Monthly arrivals by country, visa type, port

4. **Full source inventory:** See the CSV artifact created earlier in chat or `Immigration Data Sources Master Inventory v2.csv`

## Data Model Summary

**5 Main Tables:**
1. `arrivals` — People entering US at ports of entry
2. `visa_issuances` — Visas issued by embassies
3. `visa_refusals` — Denied visa applications
4. `inadmissibles` — People denied at ports of entry
5. `overstays` — People who stayed past authorization

**Full schema:** See `docs/data_dictionary.md` in repo

## Commands Reference (for later)

```bash
# Clone repo to your Mac (run in Terminal)
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/DataForge365/US-Immigration-Data.git
cd US-Immigration-Data

# Create Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install pandas openpyxl requests jupyter

# Start Jupyter in VS Code
# Just open a .ipynb file and VS Code handles it
```
